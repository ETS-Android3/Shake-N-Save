# Shake-n-Save
Android Application developed for the purpose of Women and Public Safety. The application sends the location details of the user to his/her SOS contact, thus alerting the contact about his/her trouble to seek immediate help.
If a woman or any person is travelling alone in unknown areas, then he/she can use this app if risk is felt.
In case of emergency, just by shaking the phone, you current location, battery level will be sent to your SOS contact notifying them about your position. Shaking is a key features which makes this utility possible in case of unexpected event such as accicent(the phone will be shaken in case it's hit or stolen). As we use SMS, we can pass the message without having internet.
